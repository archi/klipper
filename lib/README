This directory contains external library code.

The pjrc_usb_serial directory contains code from:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_serial.html
version 1.7 (extracted on 20160605). It has been modified to compile
on recent versions of gcc, to support asynchronous notification of
incoming data, and to not use SOF interrupts. See usb_serial.patch for
the modifications.

The cmsis-sam3x8e directory contains code from the Arduino project:
  https://www.arduino.cc/

  https://github.com/dinuxbg/pru-gcc-examples
revision 425a42d82006cf0aa24be27b483d2f6a41607489. The code is taken
from the repo's hc-sr04-range-sensor directory. It has been modified
so that the IEP definitions compile correctly. See pru_rpmsg.patch for
the modifications.

Due to licensing questions, cmsis-stm32f1xx is not included.
I extracted it from this example project:
 http://stefanfrings.de/stm32/blink_CMSIS.zip
Patch lib/cmsis-stm32f1xx/CMSIS/device/stm32f1xx.h line 90 to COMMENT the #define STM32F103xB
TODO get a better source
