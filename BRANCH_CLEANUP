This branch compiles *something*. I did not test it. Use at your own risk.

Things in need of clean up:

MCU name
    Code is only STM32F1x3 as of now (variant: 20kB RAM, 64 or 128kB Flash)
    Naming should reflect this

src/generic/alloc.c
    The default 20Kb dynamic memory in RAM is too much for the STM32F1x3
    Quick fix: I set it to 15kb
    Maybe make this a compile time variant

Makefile
    I had to add an LDFLAGS

Lib
    I used libmaple because of some interim issues.
    Since libmaple is inactive, it should be changed to stm32duino.
    Drawback: That needs a script to reconstruct a usable lib
    Plus: I can include it
